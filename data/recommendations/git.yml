title: "Version Control System: Git"
priority: 1000
intro: A version control system allows teams to collaborate and work on code together. We recommend Git as it has become most widely used in recent years.
description: |
  A version control system tracks the history of changes of source code and
  allows teams to collaborate on code together and work and change files at the same time.

  Using a version control system allows to review new changes side by side rollbacks to any previous version is easily possible.

  In recent years [Git](https://git-scm.com/) has become one of the most widely used and recommended tools to manage and develop source code in a team.

  We recommend to any development team to use Git to manage source code and any related files.

  ### Useful tools

  There are different services that provide hosting for software development version control, for example:

  * [GitHub](https://github.com) (free version)
  * [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) (Open Source)
  * [GitLab](https://gitlab.com)
  * [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)

  ### How to get started

  Even though Git tries to make it easy to get started it might be hard to switch to a new version control system.
  We recommend starting with a small, new project to get started and learn about Git and how it works for your team.

  Once that goes well and the team is confident you can run version control systems side by side and then fully migrate to Git.
