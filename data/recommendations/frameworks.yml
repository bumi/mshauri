title: Web Application Frameworks
intro: Web frameworks provide skeletons to build applications in a standard way. We recommend the use of open source frameworks for efficient development.

  A web framework (WF) or web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to support the development
  of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and
  deploy web applications.

  Web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development.
  For example, many web frameworks provide libraries for database access, templating frameworks, and session management,
  and they often promote code reuse.

  We highly recommend to use a standard web framework to build applications.

  ### Some benefits of using web frameworks are the following:

  * Eliminate the need to write a lot of repetitive code that you will find being used in many different applications
  * Frameworks combine many proven best-practices in the software development world
  * In most cases, the frameworks come with good documentation and support for most common development problems
  * Provide standard structures and conventions that make it easy for developers and new developers to get started
  * Simplify maintenance due to common standards and best practices
  * Allow re-usage of common components (like database integration, data validations, session management, authorization system, etc.)
  * Can be extended with many community contributed features and thus require less development work

  ### Example web application frameworks

  * [Laravel for PHP](https://laravel.com/)
  * [Ruby on Rails for Ruby](https://rubyonrails.org/)
  * [Symfony for PHP](https://symfony.com/)
  * [Django for Python](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
