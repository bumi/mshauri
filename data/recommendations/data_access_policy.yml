priority: 50
description: |
  A data access policy establishes and defines the responsibilities and roles of users who are granted access to any kind of data within a company or software system.

  The purpose of specified data access policies is to protect any kind of data stored in a software system.
  It tries to protect the stored data from unauthorized access (internal and external).

  Those policies define who can access what data of a system through which process.
  Access should be granted selectively and should have a default expiry period after which the access has to be renewed and e.g. passwords have to be changed.

  Permissions and policies must be different on every environment (e.g. production vs. test environment).

  To get started document each data store and each person and process to access and update that data.

  ### Audit Logs for System Activities
  In order to monitor data access and modification systems should generate comprehensive audit logs.
  Such logs help to analyze and monitor each activity on the system and quickly identify anomalies and potential breaches.

  ### How to get started
  An good way to get started is to list every relevant data storage of your project. For example a database.  
  Then document every person and compontent that has access to that data. For example: an application and a system administrator have credentials to the database.  
  Now you can define rules on that access. For example password requirements, or how often the password needs to be changed.
