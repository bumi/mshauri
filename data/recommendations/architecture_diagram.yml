title: Architecture diagram
intro: A graphical representation of a software system which makes it easier to understand the system as a whole.
  description: |
    An architecture diagram is a graphical representation of a software system that contains all components and their relation to each other.  
    Such a high-level diagram provides an overview of the whole system and allows system developers to understand, clarify, and communicate the various required components.

    The architecture diagram is an important part of the documentation and depending on the industry it is required for certain regulatory approval and external system audits.

    There is no fixed definition on how an architecture diagram must look like, and there is no wrong way to do it. 
    As English idiom which says "a picture is worth a thousand words" any image makes a complex idea or system easier to understand and conveys its meaning or essence more effectively than a description does.
