  Services like [GitHub](https://github.com/) provide code hosting solutions that make collaborating on source code in teams easy and efficient.
  They provide features to track and review code changes. Development workflows like [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
  provide great ways to review code in teams and by that improve the qualtiy, catch errors and learn from each other.

  GitHub is most widely used and also hosts the development of many open source tools.
  Because of the collaboration features and because it is most widely used internationally we recommend the use of GitHub.
