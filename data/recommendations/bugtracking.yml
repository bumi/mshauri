description: |
  A ticket management system is a tool / a piece of software used to organize issues and ToDos relevant to the software development process.
  
  The goal is to collect all information in one place, eliminate manual processes, and improve communication between all involved stakeholders - company and customers.
  
  The ticket management system is the basic requirement to apply any efficient [software development process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process).
  It can be part of general [project management tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_software) that help to plan, organize and manage any kind of project.
  
  ### How to get started
  To get started you need to simply follow a simple idea: write every todo/issue/bug down. It does not matter if you use a tool
  or simply pen & paper. Important is that you create small, specific tickets from everything that the team needs to to do.

  You can stick your tickets then to a wall, like on this Kanban board:

  Or you can organize those tickets on one of the tools mentioned below.

  Each ticket then is passed through different stages, e.g. "planned", "doing", "review", "done" and any relevant information can be collected in the ticket.
