  Most companies face uncertainties while building products and growing the company. 
  For any company it is helpful to validate certain business assumptions and base decisions on actual data (and less on instinct). 
  Collecting any kind of data and creating key performance indicators ([KPIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator)) are helpful to evaluate the success of your actions. 

  For web applications we recommend to use analytics tools to track and analyze actual user behavior.  
  This helps to understand what and how users behave on the website and to identify potential issues.
