  Software testing is defined as an activity to check whether the actual results match the expected results and to ensure that the software is working as expected.
  It involves execution of a software component or system component to evaluate the various functionalities.

  Testing is important because software bugs could be expensive and have a huge effect on companies and people who rely on the software.

  There are many different types of testing that you can use but it is important to have a well-defined process and documented testcases that can be easily executed when needed.
