  Most important for every team is to constantly learn and gether new skills. The software development world is moving fast and is constantly changing and improving.
  Teams have to keep up with that and strive to improve.

  Software development is a constant learning process. We recommend every team reserves some time to learn and to teach each other new skills.  
  For example you could do regular presentations by team members to tell others about new ideas and skills.
