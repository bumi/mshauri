  Following international coding style guides and following certain best practices and standards for any programming language makes it easier to collaborate together and makes source code more maintainable and readable. 

  We recommended to use style guides of companies like Google, AirBnB as examples: 

  * [PHP-FIG Basic Coding Standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-1/)
  * [AirBnB JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
  * [AirBnB Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/ruby)
  * [The Ruby Style Guide](https://rubystyle.guide/)
  * [wikipedia: Best Coding Practices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_coding_practices)


  There are linting tools that help you to validate the coding stlye in your projects:

  * [PHPLint - PHP linter](https://github.com/overtrue/phplint)
  * [ESLint - JavaScript linter](https://eslint.org/)
  * [Rubocop - Ruby linter and formatter](https://docs.rubocop.org/en/latest/)


  Get started by adding a linting tool for your programming language to your project.
