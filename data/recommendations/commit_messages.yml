  Whatever version control system is used, it is helpful to write descriptive commit messages.
  The commit message explains the changes and should be seen as documentation for the committed code changes.

  Good descriptions help team members to review the code changes and make the code easier to understand in the future.
  The message can be of any length (longer, with more details is mostly better) and
  should describe why a change is needed and how a change addresses that issue.
