intro: 
description: |
  A knowledge base is a library of information about your company, product, service or any topic that is important to your team. 
  It helps you to document and collect any information important to fulfill your companyâ€™s tasks and to share information within your team or with customers. 
  
  A knowledge base can include FAQs, troubleshooting guides, and any other nitty gritty details you may want or need to know.
  
  It is especially helpful for new employees to learn anything important to your company and to get started quickly.

  We recommend having a wiki style knowledge base to collect and document all relevant information in a team.
