title: Automated Software Tests
description: |
  Manual testing is done in person, by clicking through the application. This is very expensive as it requires someone to set up an environment and execute the tests themselves, and it can be prone to human error.

  We recommend to automate tests using scripts that are executed by a computer.  
  Those tests are more robust than manual tests and can be executed any time when a change is made.

  Automated testing is a key component of continuous integration and continuous delivery and it's a great way to scale your QA process as you add new features to your application.

  There are many different types of tests, but to get started we recommend automated functionality tests.

  Functional tests test the functionality of the whole system (and not specific units).  
  Functional testing is conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified functional requirements.

  ### How to get started
